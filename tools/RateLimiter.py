    Token bucket refilled at `rate_per_minute`, holding at most `burst` tokens.

    Two things the old fixed-interval decorator couldn't do:
      * absorb a burst after an idle period instead of hard-spacing every call
      * back off when the remote side throttles us, via penalize()

    It also never sleeps while holding the lock - waiters reserve their tokens,
    release, then sleep, so arrival order is preserved and threads don't queue
    up on the mutex.
